                    all the time. I also love traveling and nowadays I consider myself a citizen of the world. I am from
                    Brazil, but have been living abroad since August of 2022, when I received an offer and moved to
                    Bogotá, Colombia. <br> I dream about living in several countries and is something I am planning for
                    the next few years.

                <p data-key="aboutTextTwo">I am a 23-year-old beginner Software Developer with a short experience in Front-end Development.
                    I started with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, which is what I am majoring in. In May
                    2024, I started my first course about Web Development at CoderHouse, an Argentinian online
                    school where I was taught about HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Git, GitHub, Bootstrap (Framework), best SEO
                    practices, and also how to deploy a website. After this course, I immediately started a
                    JavaScript course, however, now at Coursera, where I took the "Programming with JavaScript"
                    course taught by Meta employees. At this moment I am taking all the courses in the Meta
                    Front-end Developer Career at Coursera, which includes 7 total courses (HTML and CSS in depth,
                    React Basics, Advanced React, Version Control, APIs, Principles of UX/UI design, and Programming
                    with JavaScript.) Also, there is another segment, which is the "Front-end Developer Capstone,
                    which is a mini course where you have to deliver a project and it becomes content for a personal
                    portfolio to show to recruiters.
